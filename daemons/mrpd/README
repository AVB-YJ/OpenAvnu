INTRODUCTION

The MRP daemon is required to establish stream reservations with compatible AVB
infrastructure devices. The command line selectively enables MMRP (via the 
-m option), MVRP (via the -v option), and MSRP (via the -s option). You must 
also specify the interface on which you want to bind the daemon to 
(e.g. -i eth2). The full command line typically appears as follows:
	sudo ./mrpd -mvs -i eth2

Sample client applications - mrpctl, mrpq, mrpl - illustrate how to connect, 
query and add attributes to the MRP daemon.

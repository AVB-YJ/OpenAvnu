{"name":"Open-AVB","tagline":"Open AVB - an AVnu sponsored repository for Audio/Video Bridging technology","body":"\r\n.. image:: avnu_logo.png\r\n\r\nOpen AVB\r\n========\r\n\r\nThe Open AVB project is sponsored by the AVnu Alliance.\r\n\r\nThe intent is to provide components for building AVB systems. The repository\r\ncontains primarily network building block components - drivers, libraries,\r\n\\example applications  and daemon source code - required to build an AVB system.\r\nIt is planned to eventually include the various packet encapsulation types,\r\nprotocol discovery daemons, libraries to convert media clocks to AVB clocks\r\nand vice versa), and drivers.\r\n\r\nThis repository does not include all components required to build a full \r\nproduction AVB system (e.g. a turnkey solution to stream stored or live audio \r\nor video content). Some simple example applications are provided which \r\nillustrate the flow - but a professional AVB system requires a full media stack \r\n- including audio and video inputs and outputs, media processing elements, and \r\nvarious graphical user interfaces. Various companies provide such integrated \r\nsolutions.\r\n\r\nFor more information about AVB, see also the AVnu Alliance webpage at\r\nwww.avnu.org.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n===========\r\n\r\nIntel created the Open AVB repository to encourage collaborative source code \r\ndevelopment for AVB technology enabling. By publishing the source code, our \r\nintent is to encourage standardization, stability and inter-operability between \r\nmultiple vendors. This repository - created by the Intel LAN Access Division - \r\nis open for contributions from other vendors. \r\n\r\nLICENSING AND CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES\r\n======================================\r\nTo the extent possible, content is licensed under BSD licensing terms. Linux \r\nkernel mode components are provided under a GPLv2 license. The specific license \r\ninformation is included in the various directories to eliminate confusion. We \r\nencourage you to review the ‘LICENSE’ file included in the head of the \r\nvarious subdirectories for details.\r\n\r\nThird party submissions are welcomed. Our intent for third party content \r\ncontributions is to enable derivative products with minimal licensing \r\nentanglements. Practically speaking, this means we would enforce (a) an \r\noriginal-source attestation for any contributed content, and (b) rejecting \r\npatches with GPL content into existing “BSD” licensed components. Third \r\nparty copyrights can be included provided they do not narrow the licensing \r\nterms of an existing component.\r\n\r\nPrior to accepting a commit, Intel may perform scans using third-party tools \r\nto identify suspected hits of GPL code. Intel may also perform vulnerability \r\nscans of patches in an attempt to find various coding errors such as memory \r\nleaks, buffer overflows and usage of uninitialized variables. The submitter \r\nwill be asked to correct any detected issues prior to a commit. Owners\r\nof submitted third-party content are free to apply changes without supervision\r\nby Intel.\r\n\r\nThe Open AVB project has a development mailing list.

AVDECC is a management layer, similar to SNMP MIB formats, \r\nwhich enables remote devices to detect, enumerate and configure AVB-related \r\ndevices based on their standardized management properties.\r\n\r\n+ https://github.com/jdkoftinoff/jdksavdecc-c\r\n\r\nAudioScience has created a 1722.1 C++ controller library which builds on jdkadvecc-c.\r\n\r\n+ https://github.com/audioscience/avdecc-lib\r\n\r\nXMOS\r\n----\r\nXMOS is a semiconductor company providing a reference design for AVB \r\nendpoints in pro audio and automotive. XMOS endpoint source code is open source \r\nand available on Github - https://github.com/xcore/sw_avb\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

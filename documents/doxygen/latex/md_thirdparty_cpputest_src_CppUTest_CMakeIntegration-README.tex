It is possible to integrate Cpp\+U\+Test as a sub-\/module of an enclosing C\+Make project. This may be useful if Cpp\+U\+Test is being built for a target platform other than that of the development host. The following is an example how an external project can refer to this C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt to build Cpp\+U\+Test as a library and include it as a target dependency.


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 cmake\_minimum\_required(VERSION 3.7)
2 project(trying\_CppUtest)
3 
4 SET(CppUTestRootDirectory /path/to/cpputest)
5 
6 # Either set CPP\_PLATFORM to one of the provided platforms under
7 # $\{CppUTestRootDirectory\}/src/Platforms/, or provide a project-specific
8 # platform.cpp (as shown below)
9 add\_subdirectory($\{CppUTestRootDirectory\}/src/CppUTest CppUTest)
10 target\_sources(CppUTest
11     PRIVATE
12         $\{PROJECT\_SOURCE\_DIR\}/UtestPlatform.cpp
13 )
14 
15 add\_executable(trying\_CppUtest main.cpp)
16 target\_link\_libraries(trying\_CppUtest CppUTest)
\end{DoxyCode}

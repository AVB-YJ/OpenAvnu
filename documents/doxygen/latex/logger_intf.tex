\section*{Description}

This interface module is a talker only and design to send O\+P\+E\+N\+A\+VB A\+VB internally log message over A\+VB for a listener to act on (such as display). One use case of this interface module is for low end devices that either have no provisions for console output or are restricted in C\+PU cycle to lot messages.

For this interface module to be used the logging system must be built with the option O\+P\+E\+N\+A\+V\+B\+\_\+\+L\+O\+G\+\_\+\+P\+U\+L\+L\+\_\+\+M\+O\+DE set to T\+R\+UE.

Typically the TX rate for this interface module can be quite low. The actual value will depend on how much data is expected to be logged. For general purpose use it is recommended to use 1000 packet per second or less.

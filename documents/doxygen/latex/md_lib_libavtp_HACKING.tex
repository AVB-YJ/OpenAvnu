If you have a bug fixed or added support for some A\+V\+TP feature, your patches are welcomed! In order to get your patches merged faster, please follow the guidelines\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Check if all patches are following the coding style from libavtp project. See section \textquotesingle{}Coding Style\textquotesingle{} for more information.
\item Before submitting your patch to review, make sure it doesn\textquotesingle{}t break any unit test. See section \textquotesingle{}Running Unit Tests\textquotesingle{} for information about how to build and run unit tests.
\item Besides the bugfix/feature itself, also provide unit test covering the code you\textquotesingle{}re contributing. See section \textquotesingle{}Code Coverage\textquotesingle{} to check how you can easily generate coverage reports and see where you need to work on to get your code covered.
\item If your patch adds new public A\+P\+Is to libavtp, please also provide patches adding example applications (or modify an existing one if it makes sense) which demonstrate how to use the new A\+P\+Is.
\item Make sure the author\textquotesingle{}s name and email are set properly.

\section*{Coding Style}

The coding style from libavtp is pretty much the same from Linux kernel described in \href{https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html}{\tt https\+://www.\+kernel.\+org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-\/style.\+html}.

The style for line wrapping is to indent as far as possible to the right without hitting the 80 columns limit.

Example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 /* Correct */
2 int avtp\_aaf\_pdu\_set(struct avtp\_stream\_pdu *pdu, enum avtp\_aaf\_field field,
3                                 uint64\_t val)
4 
5 /* Wrong */
6 int avtp\_aaf\_pdu\_set(struct avtp\_stream\_pdu *pdu, enum avtp\_aaf\_field field,
7              uint64\_t val)
\end{DoxyCode}


\section*{Running Unit Tests}

Unit tests required libcmocka so make sure you have cmocka packages installed in your system.

Run the following command to build and run all unit tests. Make sure the build system files are generated already, see section \textquotesingle{}Build\textquotesingle{} in the R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+md file for more information.


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 $ ninja -C build test
\end{DoxyCode}


\section*{Code Coverage}

Meson build system provides some built-\/in code coverage support based on {\ttfamily lcov} so make sure you have this package installed on your system in order to generate coverage reports.

To generate html reports run the following commands\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 $ rm -rf build/
2 $ meson build -Db\_coverage=true
3 $ ninja -C build/ test
4 $ ninja -C build/ coverage-html
\end{DoxyCode}


The coverage report can be found in build/meson-\/logs/coveragereport/ directory.
